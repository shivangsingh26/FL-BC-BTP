In order to run the model:

1)Dataset-You need to have any non idd FV image dataset pre downloaded locally on your system.

2)Following Python libraries pre installed:
    a)Numpy 
    b)Tensorflow
    
    pip install numpy
    pip install tensorflow
3)Having gpu support on tensorflow would drastically increase training speeds. To enable the gpu:
Follow this tutorial by tensorflow - "https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/gpu"

4)Sample2.ipynb is the main jupyter notebook.

5)convert into sets.ipynb is the file used to structure the cluttered dataset into a labelled file system.

6)gpu-test.ipynb is the file used to test if tensorflow in your editor is using the desired gpu or not.
